# Merkle Tree

This is a simple implementation of a Merkle Tree in Golang.Merkle tree also known as hash tree is a data structure used for data verification and synchronization.
It is a tree data structure where each non-leaf node is a hash of itâ€™s child nodes. All the leaf nodes are at the same depth and are as far left as possible.
It maintains data integrity and uses hash functions for this purpose.

## Functions

New - Build tree from a list of blocks , check test file for more details. It generates
proofs for each block and generates root hash.

Verify - Provide a block and proof to verify if the block is in the tree.

Proof - Generate a proof for a specific block.

Uses SHA256 as the hash function.

## Usage

```
make build - to build the binary
make test - to run the tests
```

## Installation

```
go get -u github.com/hitenjain14/merkle-tree
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add more tests
- [ ] Add more documentation
- [ ] Add parallelism so tree can be built faster
